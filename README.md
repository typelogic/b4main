# A re-look into C++
I hit my head one day on the wall, and suddenly began to ask some weird 
questions. Is *main ()* really the beginning of the first application 
instruction? I also wanted to have just one file to accumulate throughout 
the process of examining C++ behaviours rather then having a bunch of 
scattered files each with their own main. A single reference file that can 
examine the entire depth of C++.
